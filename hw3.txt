aop labs:
support for @Benchmark or
every time when DBException happens we need to send a mail to
all dba (their mails are in property file)


write service which has method which recieve message and
run different logic according to message value
like
switch(message)
 case "a"
    // 20 lines of code
 case "b"
    // 30 lines of code

without switch (remez - use Map)
